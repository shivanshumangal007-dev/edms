# Endpoint Data Management System (EDMS)
_Standalone system for a team building microservices_

## Core Idea
During development stages `endpoints` may not change, but the associated QP pairs keep changing. The change is not just linked to the QP schemas which might be static or in rare cases well defined, but also related to the data bound to the keys contained in the QP. So, it leads to a problem we define as `EQP Chaos`. 

## Eliminate `EQP Chaos`
* _Communication breaks_ when multiple servers talking to each other with evolving QP pairs per E
* _Systemic mess_ when a simple change in either of `E, Q or P` happens
* _Coordination delays_ accruing technical debt, when several team members are modifying microservice data 
  - :x: endpoints not versioned
  - :x: endpoints not mapped against all the linked QP pairs per E
  - :x: endpoint inventory summary and management
  - :x: no inbuilt tool for doc generation of EQP pairs

So, EDMS helps to reduce the chaos so that development progresses without hassle, regardless of the team size, without having to compromise speed or efficiency.  

## Features
* :white_check_mark: **Web View** - Users can create a `hostable static website` view for all the filtered set of endpoints
* :white_check_mark: **Repo Ready** - Versioned EQP Data can be generated in a way that's easy to push to a repo
* :white_check_mark: **Test View** - Endpoints can be tested in real time with advanced options 
* :white_check_mark: **Filter / Merge Data** - Endpoints from multiple sources / team members can be easily filtered into independent collections or merged into one collection
* 🚧 **Share** - Sharing endpoints with teams `Work-In-Progress`
* 🚧 **Online Backup** - Securely backup your EQP data online `Work-In-Progress`

### Symbols 
* `E` : **Endpoint** 
* `Q` : **Request**
* `P` : **Response**

`EQP` : All data related to _Endpoints_
